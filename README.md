# 5A Prototype VR - Politecnico di Milano
**Autonomie per l'Autismo Attraverso realtà virtuale, realtà Aumentata e Agenti conversazionali**

## Project
The project aims to integrate immersive virtual reality, augmented reality and conversational agents to improve the social autonomy of high functioning autistic people.
The prototype, developed for the course Advanced User Interfaces, is a playable scenario for the Oculus Quest 2 in which the user buys a ticket for the Milano subway.

## Solution
The experience is split into 3 sub-scenarios: selecting the right metro entrance, individuating the ticket machine, and the interaction with the ticket machine. Each scenario can provide additional difficulty levels, such as distractors or receving no tips on what to do (in the case of the ticket machine).

The app is developed in Unity using C# and the Oculus integration package.
